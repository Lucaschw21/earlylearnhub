                            <br>
                            <p>Our approach is based on these principle points:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <br>
                                <p><li><strong>Students respond to challenge</strong> and errors can be viewed as opportunities to improve rather than as an indication of failure.</li></p>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong>Repetitious drill can be fun</strong>, as games increase the time-on-task and engagement through competition.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li><strong>Immediate corrective feedback</strong> facilitates improvement in performance. Parents and Childrens can quickly see mistakes and how to correct them.</li>
                            <br>
                            </ul>
